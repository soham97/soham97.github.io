Hello! I am an applied scientist at Microsoft working at the intersection of audio and natural language processing. Before, I received my masters at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and B.Tech from [VJTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veermata_Jijabai_Technological_Institute). During summers, I interned at Microsoft, Siemens R&D, Siemens and competed in Kaggle: [Google](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) (Top 15), [Quora](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification) (Top 30).  My microsoft research page can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sdeshmukh/).
