Hello! I am an applied scientist at Microsoft working at the intersection of audio and natural language processing. I received my masters from Carnegie Mellon University where my research was advised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj and Prof. Rita Singh. Prior to CMU, I received my B.Tech from VJTI, where I worked with Prof. Faruk Kazi in the area of threat modelling and natural language processing. Professionally, I spent my summers interning at Microsoft, Siemens R&D, and Siemens. My microsoft research page can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sdeshmukh/).
